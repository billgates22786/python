List comprehension is considerably faster than processing a list using the for loop.\n","\n","#List Comprehension Syntax:\n","#[expression for element in iterable if condition]\n","\n","As per the above syntax, the list comprehension syntax contains three parts: an expression, one or more for loop, and optionally, one or more if conditions. The list comprehension must be in the square brackets []. The result of the first expression will be stored in the new list.
